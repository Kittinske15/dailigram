**Dailigram** is an online diary which provides users free space to instantly collect their memories, including pictures, and share them online for exchanging userâ€™s life stories. Plus, it's accessible anywhere and anytime through internet, which is surely more convenient than carrying a diary book.
Our target group is a typical internet user who prefer writing journal online.
